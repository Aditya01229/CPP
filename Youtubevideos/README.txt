In this folder i'll be coding simultaneously while learning c++ from youtube.
I'm referring to the playlist of cpp by CodeWithHarry.
Starting this course on June 17 2023.
Let's start!

v1 --> Basic structure of C++
v2 - v6 --> Basics I already know.  SO NOT MADE NOTES.
v7 --> Reference variables, Typecasting, Float literals, local global variables.
v8 --> iomanip header file to use the setw function.   MANIPULATORS.
v9 - v11 --> Control structures, loops, switch, break and continue. ALREADY KNOW SO NOT MADE NOTES..
v12 --> Pointers (MAKING NOTES FOR REVISION.)
v13 --> Arrays and pointers.
v14 --> Structures, Unions, Enum...
v15 --> Functionss..... - Top down structural programming.
v16 --> Call by values, call by reference... Use of reference variables...Return by reference...
v17 --> Inline Functions...Static variable... Default arguments... Constantss...
v18 --> Recursion and Recursive functions....
    - In this I have written a recursive function to print fibonacci series using static variables. Go through it later again...
v19 --> Function Overloading..
v20 --> OOPs - OBject Oriented Programming system..
    - POP
    - Classes, Objects, Data Abstraction and Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism...
    - I'm not making code file for this as theory is only discussed in this video...
v21 --> Classes, access modifiers...
v22 --> Nesting of member functions...
v23 --> Memory allocation and use of arrays in Classes.
v24 --> Use of static variable in class.. Static member function to access static members...
v25 --> Array of objects & Passing Objects as function arguments... i.e classes can be defined as user defined datatypes and objects as its variable.
    - Passing this objects as arguments.
    - Making objects arrays..
v26 --> Friend Function...
v27 --> Forward Declaration and Friend class...***IMPORTANT***
v28 --> More about Friend Function... Being friend to more than one class...
v29-32 --> Constructors...   ***IMPORTANT***
    - Default, Parameterized....
    - Constructor Overloading. It's benefit, Need..
    - Default argument use..
v33 --> Program using constructor overloading... Compound Interest calculator...
v34 --> Copy constructor... 
v35 --> Destructor...To clear dynamic memmory aquired by the objects... For cleanup purpose...
v36 --> Inheritance
